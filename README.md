# File-System-Management
This program takes user input from a console or terminal to find and display the paths of all of the files in a directory (sub-directories included), and then take action on some of those files that have interesting characteristics.

*Use a compiler or a terminal to start this program.


- This program is split into three parts:

1. Searches for all files on system

2. Further specifies interested files type

3. Take actions on files

This project is a class project I have completed at University of California, Irvine, with the intention of preserving my experiences and skills learned during this process as a memory. Most noticeably, traversing through files, writing to and reading from files, using recursions, and error handlings.
